# Backend Environment Setup

Copy this file to `.env` in the backend directory and fill in your values:

```bash
# Blockchain Settlement Configuration
OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=       # Your deployer wallet private key (with 0x prefix)
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xB01f8ce6924FC535636C17d9ca491c0Fea4602d5

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
```

## Security Notes:
- NEVER commit the `.env` file to git
- Use a DIFFERENT wallet for backend (not your main wallet)
- Backend wallet only needs gas fees (0.01 ETH is enough)
- Keep private key secure - it has contract owner permissions
